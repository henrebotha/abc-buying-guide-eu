You can buy something premade, or build your own, or modify an existing fightstick to use buttons instead.

All links are to EU retailers, unless otherwise specified. Note that since Brexit, UK retailers no longer benefit from EU trade regulations, meaning you are likely to pay import fees on top of the price of the item plus shipping.
